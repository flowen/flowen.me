# Global settings applied to the whole site.  
# 
# “base” is the directory to change to before starting build. If you set base:
#        that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc, not repo root!
# “command” is your build command.
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to the root of your repo).


# Settings in the [build] context are global and are applied to all contexts 
# unless otherwise overridden by more specific contexts.
