      A good friend and I also run a small coding studio and
      <a href="https://problem.studio"> we fix problems ðŸ’™ in proper fashion </a>. Weâ€™re a tiny
      full-stack team that operates on quick scale and with a focus on quality.

      Campaign &amp; micro-sites, jam-stack, motion and interactivity. I often work in
      multidisciplinary teams to build websites and apps. Involved in all steps of the process, from
      early ideation to release and beyond. Integrating front-end code into backend frameworks or
      headless solutions. I've been told I'm a strong communicator between PM, design and backend
      developers.
