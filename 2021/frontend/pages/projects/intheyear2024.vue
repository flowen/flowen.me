    <p class="project-page__description">
      A crowd-sourced domain-squatting webshop. Visitors were able to buy shares of a squatted
      domain for $1 per share with a 100 shares per URL. This is just one of the many crazy concepts
      MSCHF creates and I was honored to build it for them this time.<br />
      MSCHF releases (a drop) every 2 weeks and thus work in a high-pressure environment. I was
      asked to create the frontend in a week and a custom backend in another. Although I had my
      doubts if I could do it, with some help in the form of boiler-code, I preceeded to continue
      and the immense pressure actually helped me achieve to build a custom backend &ndash;
      something I don't usually do &ndash; within a a week with AWS (notably DynamoDB, Lambda
      functions and Stripe) that I had never worked with before.
      <br /><br />

      Unfortunately, due to company registration, we were unable to get a Stripe API key.
      Last-minute the shop was changed to Shopify. The backend was now used to manage the frontend
      sold-out states manually. The shares were all soldout in 45min and had tops Â±5000 visitors
      realtime on the site.
